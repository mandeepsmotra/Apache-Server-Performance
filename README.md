# learn-html-javascript
Hi! We are working on <a href="http://bestonrent.com/" target="blank">BestOnRent</a>; it's a real estate project and we are doing in-house and for this we have created this repository to check html and JavaScript examples.
We are facing some javascript error on our <a href="http://bestonrent.com/paying-guest/gurgaon" target="blank">pg in gurgaon</a> page.

We are having different section in our web portal like <b>Paying Guest</b>, <b>Guest House</b>, <b>Office Space</b> and so on but the performance drop we are facing in Paying guest segement only as error flow through rest of the sub pages we have created like <a href="http://bestonrent.com/paying-guest/gurgaon/girls" target="blank">girls PG in Gurgaon</a> and it co-segment <a href="http://bestonrent.com/paying-guest/gurgaon/boys" target="blank">boys PG Gurgaon</a>. We are trying hard to get ride of the issue like slow performance, poor server performance and publishing some of pages, Javascript errors etc.

Hoping that it will be short-out within 1 week.

For more info pls get in touch on email @t bestonrent dot com
