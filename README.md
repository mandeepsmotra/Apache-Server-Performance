# Pages performances issues using Helix 3
Hi! We are working on <a href="http://bestonrent.com/" target="blank">http://bestonrent.com</a>; it's a real estate project and we are doing it in-house. For our easy we have created this repository to test our html and JavaScript examples.
We are facing some javascript error and performance lag on our paying guest house page.

We are having different section into our web portal like <b>Paying Guest</b>, <b>Guest House</b>, <b>Office Space</b> and so on but the performance drop we are facing in paying guest segement only as error flow through the rest of the sub pages we have created like <a href="http://bestonrent.com/paying-guest/gurgaon/girls" target="blank">http://bestonrent.com/paying-guest/gurgaon/girls</a> working women PG Gurgaon and its co-segment <a href="http://bestonrent.com/paying-guest/gurgaon/boys" target="blank">http://bestonrent.com/paying-guest/gurgaon/boys</a> boys pg in Gurgaon. We are trying hard to get ride of the issues like slow performance of the pages, poor server performance after publishing some of pages.

Hoping that it will be short-out at earliest.
