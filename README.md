# learn-html-javascript
Hi! We are working on <a href="http://bestonrent.com/" target="blank">BestOnRent</a>; it's a real estate project and we are doing it in-house. For our easy we have created this repository to test our html and JavaScript examples.
We are facing some javascript error and performance lag on our <a href="http://bestonrent.com/paying-guest/gurgaon" target="blank">paying guest house page in gurgaon</a>.

We are having different section into our web portal like <b>Paying Guest</b>, <b>Guest House</b>, <b>Office Space</b> and so on but the performance drop we are facing in paying guest segement only as error flow through the rest of the sub pages we have created like <a href="http://bestonrent.com/paying-guest/gurgaon/girls" target="blank">working women paying guest house in cyber city Gurgaon</a> and its co-segment <a href="http://bestonrent.com/paying-guest/gurgaon/boys" target="blank">boys paying guest house in Gurgaon</a> region. We are trying hard to get ride of the issues like slow performance of the pages, poor server performance after publishing some of pages.

Hoping that it will be short-out at earliest.

get in touch with us on email @t bestonrent dot com
